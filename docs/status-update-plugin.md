## Requirements (R)

| ID  | Requirement                                                                                                                         | Status    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| R0  | `/status-update` command produces a standup-ready text output                                                                       | Core goal |
| R1  | Output includes an exec summary (1-3 sentences)                                                                                     | Core goal |
| R2  | Output categorizes work into bugs fixed, features built, refactor, and other                                                        | Core goal |
| R3  | Deterministically extract all user input from JSONL traces (user messages + AskUserQuestion tool responses)                         | Core goal |
| R4  | Scope covers the last 24 hours for the current project only                                                                         | Must-have |
| R5  | Output is text to stdout — no file written                                                                                          | Must-have |
| R6  | Classification (bug / feature / refactor / other) is done by Claude, not heuristics                                                 | Must-have |
| R7  | Plugin is a skill that delegates deterministic parsing to a CLI script                                                              | Must-have |
| R8  | CLI written in Python                                                                                                               | Must-have |
| R9  | CLI groups messages by session (deterministic); Claude collapses each session group into a single work item                         | Must-have |
| R10 | CLI writes extracted signals to a scratch file in PWD; Claude reads it then the skill deletes it on cleanup                         | Must-have |
| R11 | All deterministic work (parsing, filtering, grouping) lives in the CLI; Claude is invoked only for summarization and classification | Must-have |

## Out of Scope

**`@`-mention–heavy workflows are not supported.**

Claude Code does not write `@file` mention content into the JSONL traces this plugin parses. Users who primarily interact by `@`-mentioning files and writing short surrounding messages will produce sparse or empty signals — there is no way to recover that context from the JSONL. This plugin is designed for users who write substantive messages describing their intent, questions, and decisions. Low-text / high-`@` sessions will simply not appear in the output (or will be collapsed into a minimal "Other" item), and that is the correct behavior.

## Shape A: Skill + Python CLI Parser + Claude Classifier

### Architecture

```
/status-update
    │
    ▼
Skill prompt (~/.claude/skills/status-update.md)
    │  instructs Claude to run the CLI via Bash tool
    ▼
~/.claude/scripts/status_update_parser.py
    │  encodes $PWD → project slug (replace / and spaces with -)
    │  walks ~/.claude/projects/[slug]/*.jsonl only
    │  reads last line per file; includes if timestamp >= now - 24h
    │  for included files: iterates all lines
    │    extracts type:user / isMeta:false / message.content (string)
    │    extracts tool_result content where tool_use_id matches
    │      an AskUserQuestion tool_use in the same file
    │  groups extracted messages by session file (one block per JSONL)
    │  labels each block with timestamp of first real user entry
    │  writes structured signals to $PWD/.[plugin-name]/signals.txt
    │  prints file path to stdout
    ▼
Skill instructs Claude to read $PWD/.[plugin-name]/signals.txt via Read tool
    ▼
Claude reads signals from scratch file (on demand, not inline)
    │  collapses each session group into a work item description
    │  classifies each work item: bug / feature / refactor / other
    │  writes 1-3 sentence exec summary
    │  formats three categorized bullet lists
    ▼
Skill instructs Claude to delete $PWD/.[plugin-name]/signals.txt via Bash tool
    ▼
Text output to stdout
```

| A2.2   | Instructs Claude to read `$PWD/.[plugin-name]/signals.txt` via Read tool; then delete it via Bash tool after reading                                                                                              |      |

| A3.1   | Reads signals from `$PWD/.[plugin-name]/signals.txt` (not inline context); file deleted via Bash after reading                                                                                                    |      |
| A3.2   | Collapse each session group's messages into a single work item description                                                                                                                                |      |

## Fit Check: R × A

| Req | Requirement | Status | A |
|-----|-------------|--------|---|
| R0 | `/status-update` command produces a standup-ready text output | Core goal | ✅ |
| R1 | Output includes an exec summary (1-3 sentences) | Core goal | ✅ |
| R2 | Output categorizes work into bugs fixed, features built, and other | Core goal | ✅ |
| R3 | Deterministically extract all user input from JSONL traces (user messages + AskUserQuestion tool responses) | Core goal | ✅ |
| R4 | Scope covers the last 24 hours for the current project only | Must-have | ✅ |
| R5 | Output is text to stdout — no file written | Must-have | ✅ |
| R6 | Classification (bug / feature / other) is done by Claude, not heuristics | Must-have | ✅ |
| R7 | Plugin is a skill that delegates deterministic parsing to a CLI script | Must-have | ✅ |
| R8 | CLI written in Python | Must-have | ✅ |
| R9 | CLI groups messages by session (deterministic); Claude collapses each session group into a single work item | Must-have | ✅ |
| R10 | CLI writes extracted signals to `$PWD/.[plugin-name]/signals.txt`; Claude reads it via Read tool; skill deletes it via Bash on cleanup | Must-have | ✅ |
| R11 | All deterministic work (parsing, filtering, grouping) lives in the CLI; Claude invoked only for summarization and classification | Must-have | ✅ |

**Notes:** No failures. Shape A satisfies all requirements. `@`-mention–heavy sessions are explicitly out of scope — Claude Code does not write `@file` content into JSONL, so there is nothing to parse. See "Out of Scope" section above.
